# LeNet5
Using Pytorch to build a CNN and train it from scratch for image classification.

- Model: LeNet-5
- Dataset: MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), and follow its dataset split. The validation is not required.

Using the MNIST dataset, we train the CNN (LeNet-5 model) to recognize handwritten digits to 98+% accuracy.

The model built and trained quickly achieves a high degree of accuracy on the training set and after training over 10 epochs, it achieves a test accuracy of 98+%.
